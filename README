Hedging EA


Places multiple trades with increasing lot size on either side of an inside bar on a trending currency pair. 

Tested on H4 time frame, trend detection is currently defined as a 20 period daily RSI being > 55 or < 45

Will attempt to close all orders after reaching a modest profit only, and hedge losses.


Currently working with settings as they are (some are hard coded at the moment), barring any black swan events. 


Hedged trades can be open for months in a quiet market. Profits can be quick in an active one.


The key to this system is keeping risk low by using conservative settings, but even so, would probably would never use this live due to the 
risk of a black swan event.
